This repository contains two pieces of Python code:

* `fluxes.py`: The full source code for the implementation of an algorithm to compute the electromagnetic galaxy fluxes based on a classical approach using integrals.
* `pipeline.py`: An excerpt of the SciPIC pipeline corresponding to the step that computes the interpolation matrices and then uses them to assign the fluxes for every configured filter.

This code is published as part of my PhD Thesis.
